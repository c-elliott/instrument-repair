# instrument-repair
This is a web based repair management system I developed quickly for a previous employer. It provides easy tracking of repairs between departments and records information such as equipment, serial number, customer details etc.

Warning/Disclaimer: I am not a professional PHP developer, some of the code is quite horrible and there is lots of room to improve security. Bear this in mind if you decide to use any part of it in production, its still a good reference though. 

Components:
* XHTML/CSS/PHP
* MySQL Database
